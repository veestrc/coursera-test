                &quot;It is not the critic<span style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"> who counts; </span> not the man who points out how&nbsp;the
                strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have 
                done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually
                in the area, whose face is marred by dust&nbsp; and&nbsp; sweat&nbsp; and blood;
                ...&quot;
